# :hover Pseudo-class Not Functioning

This repository demonstrates a bug where the CSS `:hover` pseudo-class fails to apply styling to a specific element, despite working correctly on others.

## Bug Description

A `:hover` pseudo-class selector is not triggering expected styling changes on a target element.  Other similar selectors using `:hover` function without issue.  The issue seems isolated to this specific element.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
3. Observe the lack of styling changes on the affected element when hovering.
4. Compare the behavior with other elements using the `:hover` pseudo-class.

## Potential Causes

* **Z-index Issues:**  Another element might be layered on top, preventing the hover effect from being visible.
* **CSS Specificity:** A more specific selector might be overriding the `:hover` style.
* **JavaScript Interference:** Javascript may be manipulating the element's style or events, preventing the hover effect from taking place.
* **Parent Element Issues:**  The parent container might have styles that are interfering with the hover effect (e.g. `pointer-events: none`).
* **Typographical Errors:** Double check for typos in selectors, property names, or values.

## Solution

The solution is provided in `bugSolution.css`, addressing the root cause of the issue (In this case, a conflicting z-index).
